Compost Bins

Steps to Compost:
1. Stack the buckets on top of each other
2. Place all non-meat-based organic matter in the top bin
3. When the top bucket filled to 4" from the top,
		place the bottom bucket on top of top bucket
4. Give the worms a few days to climb into the top bucket
		through the holes in the bottom of the bin.
5. After most of the worms are in the top bucket,
		you can do whatever you want with the 
		"worm castings".
		
Worm Castings can be used as fertilizer for:
1. Your fruit and vegetable plantings by
	spreading them on the top of the soil (the nutrients 
	go down to the roots when you water).
2. Your house plants in the same way as veggies
3. Placing fertilizing the plants around campus just
	like you do for your veggies
4. Dumped in the forest to give back to the woods.
